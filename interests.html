              <p>Over the past few years, I've slowly worked to open an online shop that sells craft patterns, mugs, shirts, hoodies and more. I started small, just selling crochet patterns and graphs.</p>
              <p>This past Christmas was my busiest season. I also became the seller of a best-selling product; a Dolly Parton inpired mug, which <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/flooofy?ref=seller-platform-mcnav&search_query=dolly+parton" target="_blank">you can see here</a>.</p>
              <p>I've currently made over 700 sales! Though I'm not as active as I was with designing new products, I do plan to continue growing my shop over time.</p>

              <h3 class="interest-titles" id="yarn">Yarn!</h3>
              <p>What can I say about yarn? It's awesome! It's addictive and it's relaxing.</p>
              <p>I started playing with crochet when I was around 9 years old. My best friend taught me the basic chain stitch. From there, I began teaching myself. It took a few years before I was able to understand patterns that other people have written.</p>
              <p>Eventually, I started writing my own patterns and I also started selling them. Over the last couple of years, I have also learned how to knit. It was pretty difficult to switch from one skill to the other, but thankfully I was able to combine the skills to make my projects look and feel even better.</p>

              <h3 class="interest-titles" id="animals">Animals</h3>
              <p>I've always loved animals! I grew up with animals. No matter where I lived, or what was going on, we always had pets. My mother grew up raising animals, so it was natural for her.</p>
              <p>I have what I call a "mini zoo". The animal members of my family include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>1 Tuxedo Cat</li>
                <li>2 Puppies (corgi + chiweenie)</li>
                <li>Fish, snails, shrimp</li>
                <li>1 Leopard gecko</li>
                <li>2 Snow boas</li>
                <li>6 Ball pythons</li>
                <li>4 Colubrid (small snakes)</li>
              </ul>

              <h3 class="interest-titles" id="gaming">Gaming</h3>
              <p>I've been playing computer games since I can remember. I remember playing on a Commadore 64, way back in the day! I eventually got into more role-playing games like Baldur's Gate, Myst, Riven and more.</p>
              <p>Around 1999, I was introduced to my first MMORPG, EverQuest. I was hooked. I played a Woodelf druidess, Tyriess Mystwolfe. I also started playing with HTML around the same time and helped maintain a webpage for my server's guild list.</p>
              <p>I've played far too many games to list here! My most-played game would have to be World of Warcraft. No matter what happens, or how many times I've quit (there have been more than a few) I keep coming back. I started WoW in 2005 and I'm currently leveling up for the next expansion.</p>
